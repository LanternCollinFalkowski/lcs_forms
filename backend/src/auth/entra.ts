 *
 * ── Why a domain hint ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A personal Microsoft account can be registered against a work email address,
 * and then the two are indistinguishable at the sign-in box. Microsoft's
 * home-realm discovery sometimes resolves such an address to the *personal*
 * account — which is not in this tenant, so the tenant-pinned authority rejects
 * it with AADSTS50020 ("from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in
 * tenant"). The person sees a hard failure on an account that is perfectly
 * healthy in the directory, and nothing about the message says which of their
 * two identities was actually used.
 *
 * `domain_hint` skips that discovery step and sends them straight to the work
 * account path, so the personal account never enters the picture. Only sent
 * when exactly one domain is configured — with several, or none (any tenant
 * account admitted), there is no single right answer and guessing one would
 * bounce legitimate people. Never sent alongside `select_account`: that is
 * somebody explicitly asking to choose, and a hint would undercut the ask.
